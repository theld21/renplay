# Renplay: notes for agents

Renplay is a self-hosted web app that plays the PC releases of Ren'Py visual novels in the browser,
on desktops and phones, with saves stored on the server. A user adds a game's normal PC download;
Renplay builds it for the web (no Ren'Py SDK, the game's code never runs on the server), streams
its assets, and syncs every save to the server so play continues on any device. HTML games (Twine
and similar) play too, as second-class citizens. Other engines are added only when their normal download plays as easily
(`docs/site/src/content/docs/engines.md`).

Read this file before changing anything. `README.md` is for users, `CONTRIBUTING.md` for human
contributors, `docs/site/src/content/docs/developers/architecture.md` explains the internals in depth, `CHANGELOG.md` records every
user-visible change.

## Product rules

These decide most review comments. Follow them without being asked.

- **Curated, not configurable.** Title, developer, tags and links come only from the game's
  catalog recipe, and users cannot edit them. Art is the one exception: the recipe gives the
  default, and a person can choose another picture or upload one for their own view, an admin for
  everyone. There are no per-install engine options in the UI. Add a setting only when a real user
  need cannot be solved by better defaults or a recipe.
- **Ren'Py first.** Renplay is a Ren'Py player. Other engines are second-class and shown as Beta:
  recognized, and supported only when their normal download plays easily (HTML games today), with
  the features that come cheap. A feature may work only for Ren'Py; never make Ren'Py worse for
  another engine. Unity and Godot web builds still install (the code stays) but are unsupported: never in the catalog,
  the docs, the website or the app's messaging. Status: `docs/site/src/content/docs/engines.md`.
- **Saves are sacred.** Never delete or rewrite save data as a side effect. Every overwrite and
  delete keeps history. Uninstall and reinstall leave saves alone.
- **Works on phones.** Every screen must work at 390 px wide in portrait and in landscape, with
  touch only (no hover). The player respects safe-area insets and has no hover-only controls.
- **Sentence case, no lowercase starts.** "Renplay" (never "renplay" in UI text or prose; the
  lowercase name is only for repository, package, image and URL names), "Installed", "Not
  installed", tags shown capitalized. No all-caps labels. Text after a "·" separator starts with
  a capital letter too.
- **Plain, short copy.** Full sentences, no jargon (say "save folder", not "config.save_directory",
  outside developer-facing places), no exclamation marks. No semicolons, em dashes, en dashes or
  ellipses in text people read: the interface, server messages and logs, docs, the changelog,
  commit and pull request text. Hyphens in compound words, and semicolons in code, are fine.
  `node scripts/check-copy.mjs` checks the interface, server messages and the changelog in CI.
- **Adult games have three levels.** Off (they do not exist for that person), Blurred (they show,
  but no picture of them is ever sent) and Shown, set by the installation, the person's account (an
  admin or a sign-in group), the person and the device. Each layer only narrows the one above. The
  server enforces the person's level and the device's on every route (`content/mode.ts`). Every route is
  listed in `adult-levels.test.ts` with what the levels do on it, so a new route fails the tests
  until it is classified. At Blurred the game plays (with its walkthrough and the person's save
  files) but no picture of it is sent. Safe-for-work games
  are never affected.
- **Safe for work on GitHub.** Nothing published (docs, screenshots, the website, the catalog)
  may show adult art, even though many games are adult. Covers of adult games are linked from the
  developers' hosting, never copied; screenshots use `--sfw` (adult pictures blurred) or
  safe-for-work art.

## Layout

```
server/            Node 24 + TypeScript (Express 5, node:sqlite, sharp, yauzl). Tests: vitest.
  src/app.ts         The HTTP app, mounting each part's routes. src/index.ts starts it
  src/services.ts    The server's parts, made once at start and given to every router and job
  src/config.ts      Environment variables, read from the table in envvars.ts
  src/db.ts          SQLite access. db-schema.ts declares and reconciles the schema and runs migrations
  src/shared/        What the server and the library both use: the adult levels, the recipe format,
                     the art types, the defaults, sizes for people (format.ts), and every answer of
                     the API (api.ts), which the server builds with `satisfies`. The library
                     imports it as @shared. It imports nothing outside itself (shared.test.ts),
                     since the library builds from it
                     Each folder below is one part of the server, with its routes in routes.ts:
  src/accounts/      Sign-in: sessions, passwords and PINs, OIDC and LDAP, tokens, who may call what
                     (access.ts), a person's own settings
  src/people/        An admin's work with people: adding, changing, removing, merging, the owner
  src/content/       The adult levels (levels.ts) and what each person may see (mode.ts)
  src/defaults/      The defaults for everyone
  src/library/       Adding games: the archives folder, uploads, installs, keeping downloads
  src/games/         The library's games, their build folders (builds.ts), the mod overlay (mods.ts)
                     with its file browser (files.ts), and walkthroughs
  src/play/          Game pages, the runtimes and the files a game streams
  src/progress/      Each person's progress with each game and their play history
  src/saves/         Everyone's saves: the store with history (store.ts), each person's store, notes
                     and pins (stores.ts), import, sync codes, backups. savefile.ts reads Ren'Py
                     save metadata
  src/recipes/       Your recipes (local.ts), read from the recipes folder
  src/catalog/       Catalog index: recipe matching, linking games to recipes, updates
  src/art/           The art cache (store.ts): five formats per game, the making order, choices,
                     uploads
  src/jobs/          Background job queue (installs, mod builds, hashing), its logs and keepalive
  src/system/        Health, storage, the system page, metrics and the dashboard widget
  src/engines.ts     Engine packs: index, download on demand, checksum, pruning
  src/pipeline/      Install pipeline: archive.ts (zip/7z/rar reading), rpa.ts (RPA split, data-only
                     pickle in util/pickle.ts), project.ts (extraction), optimize.ts (WebP),
                     progressive.ts (what streams), pack.ts (asset packs), assemble.ts (game.zip),
                     import.ts (the whole install), applymods.ts (mod builds), detect.ts
  scripts/           screenshots.mjs (Playwright, phone and desktop)
selector/          The library UI: React 19, Vite, Tailwind 4, TanStack Query. Browser tests in server/scripts/app-ui/.
  src/pages/         Library, Catalog, GamePage, AddGames, Player, Settings, Activity, Account, Users
  src/lantern/       The design system, the only UI kit: Tile, Stage, the room, Sheet, controls (Pill,
                     IconBtn, Bar, Seg, switches), ui.tsx (Spinner, Empty, Confirm, Menu, toasts),
                     focus, travel
                     (tokens and styles in src/index.css)
  src/components/    AppShell (header, tab bar, footer), AuthGuard, SaveGallery, FileBrowser, ActionMenu
  src/lib/           api.ts (fetching), queries.ts, display.ts (screen geometry), platform.ts (what
                     device and browser this is), format.ts
runtime/           Plain ES5-style scripts for the game pages: renplay-runtime.js (Ren'Py) and
                     renplay-html.js (HTML games), each with renplay-player.js, what they share, in
                     front. The server builds them (server/src/play/runtime.ts)
image/             The image's own files: nginx.conf.template and entrypoint.sh (in /app/deploy inside it)
charts/renplay/    The Helm chart
deploy/            For people running Renplay: compose.yaml, caddy/, nginx/, kubernetes/. The docs show
                     these files (a code block marked file=deploy/<path>), CI checks them (tests/examples.sh)
demo/              The public demo's image (demo.renplay.org)
docs/              Logo, screenshots, and site/: the docs (Starlight, docs.renplay.org). The Configuration
                     page is generated from server/src/envvars.ts (`npm run gen` in docs/site)
website/           renplay.org and adult.renplay.org: plain HTML and CSS, built by `build.mjs` (`sh build.sh`) into
                     dist/ and dist-adult/. The safe-for-work catalog index gives each game a page (pages/game.html)
                     and /catalog its first screen. The adult catalog is pages/catalog.html built in adult mode (a
                     build-time setting, never the hostname), behind an age question, noindex. js/catalog-view.js is
                     what the browser and the build both draw with. NEVER_SHOW_ADULT_COVERS=1 keeps adult covers
                     blurred. _redirects holds the stable addresses (/docs, /github, /demo, /adult...), www/ the
                     www.renplay.org redirect
telemetry/         The collector for the daily usage report: a Cloudflare Worker with D1 (telemetry.renplay.org),
                     its tests (`mise run check:telemetry`), deploy.sh. Not part of the image
tests/             The image's install contract, the chart's tests, the deploy/ examples
scripts/           Repo checks (writing rule, built library, website links), release.mjs, package-chart.py
mise.toml          Pinned tools, locally and in CI (CI caches them by this file)
tasks.toml         Every task, locally and in CI
```

## Structure rules

The code was untangled so that a change lands in one place. `scripts/check-structure.mjs`
(`mise run check:structure`) enforces the parts a script can see, and CI runs it. Keep to all of them.

- **One part, one folder.** Each part of the server (accounts, saves, art, catalog and the rest in
  Layout) holds its storage, its logic and its routes. A new feature goes into the part it belongs
  to, not into a folder for its layer.
- **One wiring.** `services.ts` makes every part once. Only `app.ts` and routers (a
  `create…Router`) get the `Services`. Lower modules take the few parts they use as parameters.
- **One contract.** What the server and the library share is in `server/src/shared/`, which imports
  nothing outside itself. The library imports it as `@shared`, and reaches the server only that way.
  Every API answer has its type in `shared/api.ts`, and the server builds it with `satisfies`.
- **Layers point down.** `util/` imports only `util/` and `shared/`. `pipeline/` and `util/` never
  import routes, `services.ts` or `app.ts`. In the library, `lantern/` (the one UI kit) and `lib/`
  never import `components/` or `pages/`. No import cycles anywhere.
- **No dead code.** Unused locals fail the type check. A function or constant is exported only when
  another file uses it.
- **Small files.** At most 600 lines. A few older files are larger, listed in
  `scripts/check-structure.mjs` at their size: they may only shrink.
- **Tests test behaviour.** Tests are type-checked (`server/tsconfig.test.json`). Drive the code the
  way it is used (requests, messages, the built runtime), never by cutting its source text apart.
- **Write things once.** A device check goes in `selector/src/lib/platform.ts`, a size for people is
  `bytes` in `shared/format.ts`, a control comes from `lantern/`. Look for the existing one first.

## Database changes

SQLite only, no external database and no ORM. `server/src/db-schema.ts` declares the schema once.
Startup adds missing tables, columns and indexes without changing existing definitions or removing
unknown objects. Added columns must be nullable or have a default that SQLite can add to a populated
table. The real 4.0 SQL fixture must still migrate to match a fresh library, so unsafe additions fail
in tests before reaching a person's library.

`PRAGMA user_version` is the compatibility floor, not the latest additive schema. Additions never
raise it. Numbered migration progress lives separately in the `schema_migration` settings row. Every
numbered migration first makes a database copy and stops if that fails.

Breaking changes take two releases. First add and fill the new form while keeping the old form working,
without raising the floor. Only a later release removes the old form with a numbered migration that
raises the floor. Keep the previous release able to open the library. See the worked example in
`docs/site/src/content/docs/developers/architecture.md`.

## How it fits together

```
browser ── nginx :8080 ─┬─ /                      library UI (selector/dist)
                        ├─ /g/<id>/<build>/        game page (rendered from the engine template)
                        ├─ /g/<id>/<build>/game/…  streamed assets, from assets.pack via the server
                        ├─ /engine/<version>/…     shared Ren'Py web engine (gzip)
                        └─ /api/…                  node server on 127.0.0.1:3000
```

- **Install** (`pipeline/import.ts`): read the archive in place, detect the layout and Ren'Py
  version, pick the engine (recipe, `RENPLAY_ENGINE`, or newest of the game's major version), split
  RPAs while streaming, convert images to WebP, write streamed files into one append-only
  `assets.pack` (+ `assets.json` index) and everything else into `game.zip` with the engine's
  `renpy.zip`, WebP placeholders and the streaming list. The build appears atomically as
  `/games/<id>/<build>/`; builds never change afterwards.
- **Mods** create `<build>.m<hash>/` holding only a new `game.zip` and caches; files fall back to
  the base build.
- **Playing:** the game page is the engine's `index.html` with the runtime injected. The runtime
  paces frames to the display, loads the engine compressed from Cache Storage, resumes interrupted
  `game.zip` downloads with Range requests, keeps `~/.renpy` in memory and syncs it with the server,
  restores compiled caches (bytecode and recompiled `.rpyc`), and talks to the player UI through
  `postMessage` (`renplay:*` messages).
- **Catalog:** fetched every 6 hours or on demand. Games link to recipes by id, archive or save
  folder (`Catalog.link`). The art cache (`art/store.ts`) downloads each picture once and makes every
  format into `/data/art` under content-hashed names.

## Lessons that shaped the code

- **Network storage hates small files.** Creating a file on an NFS share costs 100–250 ms,
  so builds keep streamed assets in one pack (four files per build), and deletions run as a
  `nice rm -rf` child process (`util/purge.ts`), because `fs.rm` on NFS starved Node's thread pool
  and stalled the API.
- **Never shadow browser globals in the runtime.** A variable named `caches` broke Cache Storage;
  the runtime's own is `pyCaches`.
- **Proxies change bodies.** Some gateways strip `Accept-Encoding` and some scale-to-zero
  proxies gunzip, so the engine is served as `.gz` files and decoded with `DecompressionStream`.
- **HTTP/3 drops long downloads** through some gateways (`ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR`); the runtime
  resumes `game.zip` with Range requests and shows an error with a retry button after 8 failures.
- **Ren'Py recompiles old games' scripts** on the newer web engine on every start (17 s for Pale
  Carnations); the runtime stores the recompiled `.rpyc` files with the build.
- **Vertex uploads stalled busy menus.** Emscripten emulates Ren'Py's client-side vertex arrays by
  overwriting pooled buffers (bufferSubData) before every draw; browsers' GPU processes then wait
  for earlier draws. The runtime gives each whole upload fresh storage (bufferData): 15 -> 60 fps on
  Ripples' menu (170 draws a frame). A menu that is slow while the main thread is idle points at
  the GPU process; count WebGL calls per frame before suspecting images or Python.
- **Download links do not work from the server.** File hosts (Mediafire, Mega, Google Drive…)
  tie a direct link to the browser and IP that opened it, and official stores need the user's
  login, so "install from a link" failed for real links and was removed. Games arrive by upload or
  through the archives folder. The one exception is a free game on itch.io (`library/itch.ts`): its
  game page's own Download button asks for the file with the page's session, which a server can do.
- **Ren'Py 7 games run on the Ren'Py 8 engine.** Ren'Py 8 loads their compiled scripts and
  compiles all their Python at load time, so a game that starts has no Python 2 syntax; what can
  still fail is Python 2 behaviour (xrange, iteritems, unicode). Once in a Lifetime (7.3.2)
  played through its opening, a fight minigame and more without errors. Harem Hotel (7.4.11)
  does not: it sorts numbers with text, which Python 3 refuses.
- **Python 2 code is rewritten, only Python 2 code.** Ren'Py 8 marks Python loaded from an old
  `.rpyc` with `PyExpr.py == 2`. `py2compat.ts` (`game/!renplay_py2.rpy`, named to load before any game
  file, since Ren'Py compiles each file's Python as it loads it) wraps `renpy.python.py_compile`
  (and the copy `renpy.pyanalysis` imported, which screens use) and `wrap_node`, and rewrites only
  that code, and code that compiles only once its Python 2 syntax is fixed: integer `/`, list-returning `keys()`/`map()`/`zip()`, Python 2 ordering on a
  `TypeError`, `__cmp__` and friends on classes. In game code `renpy` is `renpy.exports`: the engine's
  modules come from `sys.modules`. Builds of games made with Ren'Py 8 do not get the script. A failed
  compile alone proves nothing: Ren'Py compiles every statement as an expression too. A probe game
  with 37 Python 2 idioms went from 8 to 37 working.
- **Load the developer's .rpyc, not the .rpy.** A `.rpyc` stores its source's digest with a
  marker of the Ren'Py version that wrote it, so Ren'Py 8.5 sees every older game's `.rpyc` as
  stale and compiles the `.rpy` again, with a stricter parser and Python 3.12 (Harem Hotel's
  empty `screen`, Heros Harem Guild's `[:02]` and `xadjustment` failed that way). Builds keep
  sources out of `game.zip` when the `.rpyc` is there (`setSourcesAside`). Ren'Py's own Python 2
  fixer (`renpy.compat.fixes`) uses `tokenize`, which Python 3.12 makes fail on the very code it
  should fix; `py2compat.ts` retries from the error's position instead.
- **GitHub release downloads can fail for hours.** On 2026-11-08 they answered 504 all morning: no
  new install could fetch its engine, and CI steps that downloaded tools from releases failed. Engines
  are served from engines.renplay.org now (the engines repository checks every file there before
  its index names it), and CI downloads nothing from GitHub releases.
- **iPhone Safari cannot make a page fullscreen.** Only a home-screen web app fills the screen;
  the player explains that instead of showing a broken button.

## Commands

`mise.toml` pins the tools and `tasks.toml` holds every task. CI runs the same tasks.

```sh
mise install && mise run install    # tools and npm packages
mise run dev                        # server on :3999 (data in /tmp/rp) and library on http://localhost:5199
RENPLAY_BACKEND=https://renplay.example mise run dev:ui   # library against a deployed server
mise run check                      # everything CI checks, or one part: check:server, check:ui,
                                    # check:docs, check:website, check:layout (layout shift of the website and docs),
                                    # check:chart, check:copy, check:workflows, check:examples
mise run test                       # server tests only
mise run test:ui                    # all browser checks in the pinned Linux container (Docker)
mise run image && mise run contract # the image as renplay:dev, its install contract, deploy/compose.yaml
mise run screenshots http://localhost:5199 /tmp/shots --sfw   # phone and desktop, read-only
mise run release 4.4.0              # a release branch's versions and changelog (release skill)
```

Inside `server/`: `npx tsc -p .` builds to `dist/`, `npx tsc -p tsconfig.test.json` type-checks the
tests (vitest runs them without), `npx vitest run src/__tests__/x.test.ts` runs one test file. Screenshots need `npx playwright install chromium webkit` once.

## Definition of done

1. `mise run check` passes: type checks (the tests' too), tests, the structure rules and the writing
   rule. New behavior has a test (`server/src/__tests__`).
2. The UI type-checks and builds.
3. UI changes are looked at on a phone size (WebKit, iPhone) and a desktop size, using
   `npm run screenshots` or Playwright directly. No page errors.
4. Browser acceptance is `mise run test:ui`, the pinned official Playwright Linux image with Node 24.
   Native Mac browsers are for quick tries only. The Playwright suite uses one worker, desktop Chromium, and touch
   WebKit in portrait and landscape. While working, run only the tests a change touches, using
   `sh scripts/test-ui.sh --warm playwright --grep <behavior>` or `--warm legacy --only <subject>`.
   Run the whole suite once at the end, in the container, and push only after it passes. Never re-run
   a passing suite to make sure. A doubt about a test is a flake to report, and the **Flake hunt**
   workflow repeats it without retries (by hand, or nightly on `dev`). Stop the warm container with
   `mise run test:ui:stop`. Results and failure traces are in `ui-test-results/`.
   A retry-only pass warns locally and fails CI. No PR screenshots.
   Never loosen a test without stopping to report it and getting a maintainer's approval: no removed assertions,
   wider tolerances, added or longer fixed waits, skips, quarantine or changes only to make it pass.
   Moving an assertion needs equivalent or stronger coverage in the new runner, not less coverage.
5. User-visible changes have a line in `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased`, written for users.
6. README or the docs (`docs/site`) updated when setup, configuration or behavior described there changed. A new
   environment variable goes in `server/src/envvars.ts`, then `npm run gen` in `docs/site`.

## Workflow

- **Branches:** `dev` is the integration branch; `main` only receives releases. Work on a short
  branch from `dev` (`feat-…`, `fix-…`), open a pull request against `dev`, squash-merge.
- **Commits and PR titles:** Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, `chore:`).
  The body says why, and what was tested.
- **The pre-push hook** (`.githooks/pre-push`, set up by `mise run install`) runs
  `mise run check:fast` before a push: types, structure, the runtimes and the writing rule, in a few
  seconds. Fix what it reports rather than pushing with `--no-verify`. CI runs it all again.
- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on pull requests into `dev` and `main`, and the
  rulesets require it: `check` (type checks, tests, the interface, docs, chart, workflow and
  deploy/ examples lint), `Install contract` (on amd64 and arm64: the image from a build cache, users
  and a read-only root, an install, the upgrade from the newest release and back, the chart on
  kind, deploy/compose.yaml; skipped when nothing in the image or the chart changed), and
  `release-check` on release PRs. Nothing runs on pushes: `dev` only gets what a PR tested.
  The browser checks run in parallel when their inputs changed. Shared script or workflow changes
  run all three, and the `Browser suite` summary reports even when all three are skipped.
  Superseded runs of the same pull request are cancelled. Upgrades are tested from the newest release.
- **Workflows:** `release.yml` (push to `main`), `image.yml` (the multi-arch image, called by the
  release and by `edge.yml`), `edge.yml` (by hand: an `edge` image to try a branch on a server),
  `sites.yml` (the docs and the website, with each release or by hand, and the website also daily and on a `catalog-updated` repository_dispatch, since its game pages follow the catalog), `demo.yml` (the demo, with each release or
  by hand). Actions are pinned by commit SHA, Dependabot keeps them and the
  npm and Docker dependencies current (weekly, grouped, into `dev`). `actionlint` and `zizmor` check the workflows.
- **Releases:** see the `release` skill. A `release-X.Y.Z` branch from `dev` bumps
  `server/package.json` and `selector/package.json`, moves `Unreleased` into a dated
  `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section, and is squash-merged into `main`. CI checks versions and the
  changelog. `release.yml` then builds the image (`X.Y.Z` and `latest`, GHCR and Docker Hub),
  publishes and signs the chart, tags `vX.Y.Z` with the changelog section as the GitHub release,
  deploys the docs and rebuilds the demo. Afterwards `dev` fast-forwards to the release branch. (`main` only gets squashed releases, so it never shares history with `dev`; the
  release branch records it with `git merge -s ours`.)
- **Cadence:** release when a coherent set of changes is done and verified on a running instance,
  at least every few weeks while there are changes; patch releases for fixes any time.
- **Versioning:** SemVer. Minor for features, patch for fixes, major when upgrading needs action
  from the operator (the changelog says what).

## Deployment

Releases are deployed by the maintainers, pinned by tag and digest
(`ghcr.io/renplay-org/renplay:X.Y.Z@sha256:…`). To try a build on a server first, run **Edge image**
(`edge.yml`) on the branch and pin the `edge@sha256:…` digest it prints.

Agents never push to `main`, merge releases, or change a deployment on their own; they prepare
branches and pull requests and say what is left to do.

## Skills

Procedures for agents live in `.agents/skills/` (linked as `.claude/skills/`):

- `release`: cut a release (versions, changelog, PR, tag, image, deployment).
- `ui-check`: look at UI changes on a phone and a desktop before calling them done.
- `ui-review`: audit the app, the website, the docs and the catalog's pages, and rank what feels off
  (layout shift, transitions, grids, scroll memory, touch, search engines).
- `diagnosing-bugs`: a loop for hard bugs and slow paths, a failing test first.
- `untangle-codebase`: find and remove tangles (dead code, cycles, things written twice).
- `tdd`, `code-review`, `prototype`, `research`, `writing-for-agents`: from mattpocock/skills (see
  `.agents/skills/THIRD-PARTY.md`): test-first work, a review of a diff against the standards and the spec,
  a throwaway prototype for a design question, research into primary sources, and writing skills and
  AGENTS.md for agents.
