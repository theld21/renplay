title: Adding games
description: Upload a game or drop it in the archives folder, and what happens during an install.
---

A game’s normal **PC download** is what Renplay installs: a zip, 7z or rar of the Windows, Linux or
Mac release of a Ren’Py game, or the zip of an HTML game. Get it from the developer (itch.io,
Patreon, Steam and so on).

## Two ways to add a game

- **Upload.** Open **Add games** and choose the file. Large files are sent in chunks, and an
  interrupted upload can continue.
- **The archives folder.** Copy the file into `/games/_archives/` (on the host, the `_archives`
  folder inside the folder you mounted at `/games`). It shows up in **Add games**. This is the
  better way for big files or a file already on the server.

Renplay does not install from a link. File hosts tie a direct link to the browser that opened it,
and stores need your login, so the file has to come from you. The exception is a catalog game that
is free on itch.io: its catalog page has **Download and install**, and Renplay fetches the tested
release itself. An admin's upload installs as soon as it arrives.

Add games lists every download with what Renplay found: the game, its engine and whether the
[catalog](/catalog/) knows it. A download that cannot be installed shows the reason, for example an
engine that does not run in a browser.

## What happens during an install

Press **Install**. A background job runs, and **Activity** (in the header, and in the account menu) shows its log.

1. Renplay reads the archive in place, without unpacking it to disk, and finds the game and its
   Ren’Py version.
2. It matches the catalog by checksum, file name and size, or a pattern. A recipe can pick the
   engine, files to keep or leave out, and small patches.
3. It picks the engine and downloads it on the first install (about 16 MB), checking its checksum.
4. It splits Ren’Py’s `.rpa` archives and converts PNG and JPEG images to WebP under the same
   names. The game’s code is never run.
5. Files the game streams (images, audio, video) go into one `assets.pack`. What the engine needs
   at the start goes into `game.zip`.
6. The finished build appears at once. Installed builds never change: an update makes a new one.
7. Downloads are kept by default. Turning off **Keep downloads** in Settings, or setting
   `RENPLAY_KEEP_DOWNLOADS=false`, deletes only uploads through Renplay after a successful install.
   Files you copied into the drop folder are never automatically deleted. A failed install
   keeps its download either way.

A big game takes minutes, mostly for image conversion. You can leave the page.

One job runs at a time. In **Activity**, an admin can move a waiting job up or down, or press **Do
next** to put it first, and can **Pause** a waiting or running job. A running job stops cleanly
and waits as paused. **Resume** starts it again from the archive, since a build is only kept once it
is whole. The order and the paused jobs are kept when Renplay restarts. Activity names a job by its
game, and by the file name only when no game is known. Its attempts count only the times you
pressed **Retry** on the same job.

## After an install

- **Uninstall** removes the game: its build, its download (unless another game was installed from
  it), its mods and walkthrough, and the library entry. **Saves stay**, so adding the game again
  continues where you left off.
- **Reinstall** from the kept archive makes a fresh build, and saves stay.
- **Updates.** When the catalog lists a newer tested release than the one you have, Renplay says
  so. Download the new file and add it the same way.
- **Mods.** A Ren’Py game's **Mods and files** tab (admins) starts with what your mods change: **Install
  mod zip** adds a mod as it comes, **Apply changes** builds a new version of the game with your
  mods, and **Remove all mods** goes back to the original. Below, the game's files, folder by
  folder: open a script to edit it in the browser, or use **+** for a new file or an upload. Files
  from the game are read-only originals. What you add, edit or hide is kept apart as your mod layer
  and survives updates.
- **Not finished installing.** An install that failed or was interrupted shows on the library
  home with **Retry**, and **Dismiss** for one that cannot finish.

## Several games and sequels

Sequels find the previous season’s saves, as on the desktop. Copy saves between games from the
saves view when a game keeps them in a different folder.
