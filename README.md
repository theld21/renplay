Renplay is a self-hosted library for the visual novels you download: [Ren’Py](https://www.renpy.org/)
games first, and HTML games such as Twine stories too. Add a game’s normal PC download, press
Install, and play it in any browser: on your computer, your tablet or your phone. Every save lands
on your server the moment you make it, so you can stop on the laptop and continue on the phone.
Other engines are added only when their normal download plays as easily. The
[docs](https://docs.renplay.org/engines/) say what works.

## What you get

- **Play anywhere.** Smooth, full-speed playback in the browser. On phones the game fills the
  screen around the camera cutout, and on iPhone it runs full screen from the home screen.
- **Offline, and with a controller.** Keep a game in a browser and play it with no network: saves
  made offline are sent when you are back. A controller moves around the library and plays the
  game through Ren’Py’s own buttons.
- **Separate accounts.** Local sign-in, OpenID Connect and LDAP keep each person's saves and progress
  separate. Admins manage the shared library, and players play. On a shared tablet **Who is
  playing?** switches person with a PIN. Sign-in can be switched off for a trusted home network.
- **Saves on your server.** Saves, autosaves and progress sync as you play, with earlier versions
  kept. Sequels find the previous season’s saves, just like on desktop. Import saves from the
  desktop version, export them back, or copy them between games.
- **One-click installs.** Drop in the PC zip (or 7z, rar). Renplay unpacks it, shrinks the images
  and prepares it for the web. No Ren’Py SDK, and the game’s code never runs on your server.
- **A curated catalog.** Known games get their proper title, art, links and tested settings from
  the [catalog](https://renplay.org/catalog), and Renplay tells you when a newer tested
  version exists.
- **Resume in one tap.** Up next opens your latest save straight away, with play time and your
  last save on the library home. Mark a story Finished on its game page to leave it out of Up next.
  Its saves stay safe.
- **Adult games, your way.** Three levels, Off, Blurred and Shown. Off leaves adult games out
  completely, Blurred shows them without their pictures, and the server never sends a picture a
  person is not meant to see. Each person chooses on their account page, within the admin's limit,
  and **Hide adult games here** covers a shared screen.
- **Find your next game.** Keep favourites at the top of your library, sort by last played,
  title or recently added, and search titles, developers and tags. Recent combines last played and
  recently added. Library filters stay in the
  address so Back brings them back. The catalog has search and tag filters too. Game pages show
  summaries, development state and optional content tags.
- **Mods.** Install a mod zip, browse a game’s files, or edit scripts in the browser. Your changes
  stay separate from the game and survive updates.
- **Your own recipes and dashboards.** A folder of recipe files fixes or adds games without waiting
  for the catalog. Prometheus metrics and a Homepage widget show what your server is doing.
- **Fast to start.** Games and the engine are cached in your browser, assets stream as the game
  needs them, and compiled scripts are kept, so a big game starts in seconds.

## Install

Renplay is one container. Give it a folder for games and one for data:

```sh
docker run -d --name renplay -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/games:/games \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  ghcr.io/renplay-org/renplay:latest
```

Open http://localhost:8080. On a new install, enter the setup code from `docker logs renplay`
and create the owner account. Copy a game’s PC download into `/path/to/games/_archives/`, or upload
it under **Add games**, and press **Install**. The first install also downloads the Ren’Py web
engine (about 16 MB).

The same image is on Docker Hub as `renplay/renplay`. Pin a version
(`ghcr.io/renplay-org/renplay:4.3.0`) for production. The [releases](https://renplay.org/releases)
list what changed. Use HTTPS outside a trusted local network. See [Accounts](#accounts) before
sharing an upgraded install.

[troubleshooting](https://docs.renplay.org/troubleshooting/).

**Back up `/data` and keep it on local disk:** it holds your saves and their history, accounts,
the SQLite library, mods and the art cache. SQLite must not be on a network share. `/games` and the
archives folder can be shares. Allow about twice the game's download size free during install.
Downloads are kept by default. Turn off **Keep downloads** in Settings to delete only uploads
through Renplay after a successful install. Files copied in are never deleted automatically.
`RENPLAY_KEEP_DOWNLOADS=true` or `false` sets and locks the choice. The deprecated
`RENPLAY_DELETE_ARCHIVES` alias still works with the opposite value.

Optionally mount a downloads folder at `/downloads`. Renplay uses it when it exists and is
writable, or uses `ARCHIVES_DIR` when set. Without that mount it keeps using `/games/_archives`.
Existing files are never moved. Settings shows which folder is in use. Deleting `/games` also
loses downloads stored inside it. Games can be rebuilt only while their downloads are available.
With **Keep downloads** off, a download goes once its game installed. **Uninstall** on a game's
Manage tab deletes the game and its download, never its saves.

The image defaults to user `1000:1000`. You can use any non-root IDs with `--user 568:568`, or
start as root with `--user 0:0 -e PUID=99 -e PGID=100`. The entrypoint drops root before starting
the app. Root without these variables drops to `1000:1000`. Make both mounted folders writable
by the chosen user first. Renplay does not change their ownership. A read-only root filesystem
works with writable `/data`, `/games` and a `/tmp` tmpfs. The image includes a health check through
nginx on port 8080. See the [Docker guide](https://docs.renplay.org/install/docker/).

## Accounts

New data folders require sign-in. Upgrades keep sign-in off and show an admin reminder. Set
`RENPLAY_AUTH=on` to turn it on. The first admin claims the owner and all existing saves. You can
seed the owner with `RENPLAY_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `RENPLAY_ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE` instead of a setup
code. Passwords must have at least 10 characters. The account menu shows your name and Sign out.

`RENPLAY_AUTH=off` lets everyone play as the owner, or the account id in `RENPLAY_AUTH_USER`.
Changing modes never moves or deletes other people's saves. All saves and history live under
`/data/users/<id>/`. Back up `/data` yourself too.

Cookies work on plain HTTP for a local NAS and are marked `Secure` over HTTPS. Behind HTTPS
termination, set `RENPLAY_PUBLIC_URL` to the public HTTPS address. Keep proxy hop counts correct
with `RENPLAY_TRUSTED_HOPS` (the included nginx is one hop).

Single sign-on supports OIDC providers such as Pocket ID, Authentik, Authelia and Keycloak, plus
LDAP directories such as LLDAP. Groups can control roles and adult games levels. Register OIDC's exact
callback `/api/auth/oidc/callback`. See the [provider examples](https://docs.renplay.org/accounts/).
Local usernames take precedence over LDAP and accounts are only linked explicitly while signed in.

Open **Account** from the account menu (the **You** tab on phones) to upload a profile picture, link sign-ins, change your name, password
and adult games level, manage sessions and script tokens, or export your saves. Admins use
**Settings → Users** to add users, change roles and adult games levels, disable accounts, reset passwords,
and copy, merge, export or import save folders. Overwrites keep history. Removing a user archives
their folder. These tools work with sign-in off too. More in [Accounts](https://docs.renplay.org/accounts/)
and the [Accounts API](https://docs.renplay.org/developers/accounts-api/).

## Questions

**Which games work?** Ren’Py 8 games, and most Ren’Py 7 games. HTML games such as Twine stories
play too, marked Beta. See [Engines](https://docs.renplay.org/engines/) and the
[catalog](https://renplay.org/catalog), which lists games that were tested.

**Where do I get games?** From their developers: itch.io, Patreon, Steam and so on. Renplay and
its catalog never host game files.

**Can I keep playing on desktop Ren’Py?** Yes. Export a game’s saves and they work in the desktop
version, and the other way round.
